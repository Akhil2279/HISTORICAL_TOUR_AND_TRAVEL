## ðŸ“– About the Project

Historical Tour and Travel is a full-stack web application built to provide an engaging way for users to explore and plan visits to historical destinations.  

The project demonstrates my ability to integrate **frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** with a powerful **backend (Python, Django)**, while managing and storing dynamic data in a **relational database**.  

It is more than just a static website â€” it showcases:
- **User-focused design** with responsive layouts
- **Dynamic content management** using Django views, templates, and models
- **Database-driven functionality** (destinations, packages, user details)
- **Scalable architecture** following Djangoâ€™s best practices

This project highlights my skills as a **Full Stack Developer**, with strengths in building interactive UIs, developing robust backends, and managing end-to-end application deployment.
